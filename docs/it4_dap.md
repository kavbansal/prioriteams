# Iteration Backlog

As a CA, I want to view all the events that the Professor added me to so that I can keep track of my commitments.

As a Professor, I want there to be a sign-in page so that only my CAs and myself can view and register for events and so that my information is stored.

# Tasks

Implement Sign-in

Register for an event should have unique endpoint for each event

Register page just becomes one user entering their availabilityâ€¦ that's it

Profile page will have list of meetings that have been registered for (only shows MY events)

Upon submission of availabilities, calculate/update optimal time

Deal with edge cases with algorithm

Deploy to Heroku
