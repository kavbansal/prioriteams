# Iteration Backlog

As a CA, I want to view all the events that the Professor added me to so that I can keep track of my commitments.

As a Professor, I want there to be a sign-in page so that only my CAs and myself can view and register for events and so that my information is stored.

# Tasks

Implement Sign-in

Register for an event should have unique endpoint for each event

Register page just becomes one user entering their availabilityâ€¦ that's it

Profile page will have list of meetings that have been registered for (only shows MY events)

Upon submission of availabilities, calculate/update optimal time

Deal with edge cases with algorithm

Deploy to Heroku

# Retrospective

For this iteration, we set out to clean up a lot of the existing feature that we have already implemented. Among these are the algorithm for the optimal time, the way that a user submits their avalability, a sign in page, and some changes in the flow of the website. We think that we did the best with parallel programming in this iteration compared to others, as we divided the tasks among us pretty well. The tasks include the enhancements that were previously mentioned, as well as deploying the app to heroku and cleaning up the UI. We will continue to strive for efficiently working together as a team to get the app working to our expectations.
