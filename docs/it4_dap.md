# Iteration Backlog

As a CA, I want to view all the events that the Professor added me to so that I can keep track of my commitments.

As a Professor, I want there to be a sign-in page so that only my CAs and myself can view and register for events and so that my information is stored.

# Tasks

Register for an event should have unique endpoint for each event

Resister page just becomes one user entering their availabilityâ€¦ thats it

Profile page will have list of meetings that have been registered for

Events page only shows MY events

Upon submission of availabilities, calculate time

Deal with edge cases with algorithm
