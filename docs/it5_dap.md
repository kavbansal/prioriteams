# Iteration Backlog



# To-do's

Fix create account functionality

Show person name and day of the week instead of id and a number from 1-7
 
Make font bigger and text easier to read on many of the pages

Don't show -1 on day -1 for optimal time for an event if there isnt any availabilities yet

Stess test algorithm 

Deal with location overlaps when optimal times for events are the same

Invite people to register/put in availabilities for an event

Update optimal time as soon as an availability is put in

Overall UI Improvements
