Restaurant Idea:

A recent 2018 study has shown that the restaurant industry loses roughly $162 billion dollars per year due to food wastage. This comes as a result of inefficient management of food inventory. 
Our goal is to create an application that will easily allow restaurants to label what menu items are being ordered and perform basic statistical analysis to provide insight into how companies should keep their inventory going forward. 
The application will help to create a more sustainable restaurant industry while also saving the businesses money.
