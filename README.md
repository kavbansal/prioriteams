CA Staff Meeting Time

Currently, scheudling apps lilke When2Meet and Calendly find the best times for groups to meet based on the number of people that can meet at once. However, for events such as Staff Meetings for CAs, the optimal meeting time may not be the time frame in which the most people can meet if, for example, the Head CAs cannot be present. Thus, our software application will address the issue of finding the optimal meeting time given that certain individuals' presence at the meeting will take higher priority.
