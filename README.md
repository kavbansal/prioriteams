CA Staff Meeting Time

Currently, scheudling apps lilke When2Meet and Calendly find the best times for groups to meet based on the number of people that can meet at once. However, for events such as Staff Meetings for CAs, the optimal meeting time may not be the time frame in which the most people can meet if, for example, the Head CAs cannot be present. Thus, our software application will address the issue of finding the optimal meeting time given that certain individuals' presence at the meeting will take higher priority.

SAME AS LAST WEEK! Changes are UI changes, a more robust algorithm, and a reconfiguration of the flow.

Below are steps that guides one through our product. Following these steps will allow one to view all the features of the product. THESE ARE THE STEPS WHEN RUN LOCALLY BUT STEPS SHOULD BE VERY SIMILAR WHEN ON HEROKU OTHER THAN STEPS 1-4.

1. Open both the FrontEnd and BackEnd projects in different intelliJ windows.

2. In the src directory of the BackEnd, navigate to the ApiServer java file and run the main method to get the Api server up and running.

3. In the src directory of the FrontEnd, navigate to the WebServer java file and run the main method of that to host the web server.

4. After both servers are running, open a web browser and type the following url - http://localhost:4567/

5. You are now at our home page. 

6. Create an event. Enter availabilities for the event. Calculate the optimal time for the event. Below, we attach a link to explain/walk-thru how this can be done. We also describe how the algorithm computes optimal times.
